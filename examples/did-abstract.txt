This study evaluates the causal impact of a state-level minimum wage increase on employment using a difference-in-differences design. We exploit the staggered timing of minimum wage changes across U.S. states between 2010 and 2019.

Our identification strategy relies on the parallel trends assumption, which we validate by showing flat pre-trends in an event study framework for 8 quarters before treatment. We use county-level administrative employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (N=850,000 county-quarter observations) with county and quarter fixed effects.

We find a small negative employment effect of -1.2% (SE=0.4%) in the restaurant sector, robust to alternative control groups, bandwidth choices, and the Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator for staggered DiD. Placebo tests using leads show no anticipation effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals larger effects in counties with lower baseline wages.
